Mining activities especially illegal minining activites pose a significant threat to our water supply. 

Creating the need for stakeholders that involved in processing and purifying water for usage to take another step in checking 
water quality

So say 	GWCl or drinking water producers like voltic and the likes , and 
even individuals with large water reserve  now need a faster solution for testing the purity of water 
both before and after purification 




Go get samples , go to the lab , and do laboratory analysis , each time , after each purification process 




Get a bunch of sensors that measure of the parameters involved in measuring WQI and WQC 
Feed those values to Machine Learning models to make predictions and insights


- looking at the logistics involved in making the trips to the water sources , taking periodic samples , 
the skilled labor cost , and the laboratory equipment , and their ready availability ,
time it takes to get all taht done 





Water Coductivity Sensor 125$
TDS Sensor 13$
Gravity Dissolved Oxygen Sensor $169
Ph Sensor $29
TSS $24


6,000 ghs




-- there are 5 water quality classs 
AA , A , B , C and D
according to UN environment programme

Excellent 91 - 100
Good 71 90
Average 26 - 50
Poor 0 -25


-- Collect the sensor values 
-- Feed it to models to perform predictions and generate insights
-- Store it in a database so we have historical data 

-- outlier values , toxic level get's very high we can send an alert 



-- The closest thing we have is conceptualized idea
knowing what models to use , the software system , the software architecture that would process the 
sensor values and give the appropriate respone , 
we know what models to use , 
data to stor , information to give




An integrated system 
An instant alert system 

Putting eyes on our water
